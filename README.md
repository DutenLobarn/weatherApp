- This test will assess your abilities in React, modern JavaScript, Node.js and interacting with an API. If you are able to, utilize typescript. Try to ensure a reasonable level of error handling.

Create a Node.js webservice that fetches, caches and serves a weather forecast for the Royal Palace in Stockholm. I recommend using SMHI. Discard all superfluous information; information not displayed by the frontend.

Create a React SPA that displays the data from your webservice. On the landing page, display the weather for a given day (by default, the current date), in whatever way you deem fit. Make a reasonable attempt to make the page attractive.

You are welcome to use weather-icons-react, but you are not required or limited to use it. Add navigation buttons to view the previous/following day.

Implement routing in your SPA. A user should be able to bookmark a given day, and, if the data is still available via the API, open this bookmark back up to check the forecast for that day.

Your assignment should be pushed to GitHub or an equivalent publicly accessible git service, and the link to the repository (and branch, if applicable) sent to us. The README.md in the root directory should contain all the instructions on how to run your project.

- Just follow along the buttons on the page to look the weather at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. From start u see the weather for the current date but u can have a look at up to 9 days future weather forecast.

- To start the backend u need to go to path /c/Front End/Egna Programmerings Projekt/WeatherApp/weather-app/Backend and write in the terminal: nodemon server.js.

- Bugs or shortcomings in the code: - The buttons for shifting days works fine until u update the page or bookmark it and go to that page again, then they are reset and is displayed in not always the correct date. Also it makes it possible to continue to date´s that is not availible to find correct weather for.

- Is there anything I would have done different with this project?
- I would not have spend alot of time and energy trying to solve the date issues with my own solutions, i should have earlier have started to look for librarys to help me with the most difficult assignments. For example: How to get the correct hour and days so I could use that data. Im using a method called closeTo() and that problem i struggled alot with trying to solve with a own solution.
  -I am using alot of code in both the App.js and Forecast.js files, with more time and energy i would have created a new function that i could have used in both these two files.
- Of course my design can be improved alot, it is maybe my biggest weakness as a frontend developer.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
